Method of coordination: We had online google meet meetings on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, as well as a group chat to organize everything.

Decisions made for the project that were not in the project specification:
Since the retweets table does NOT store retweet time, each retweet is stored or printed with a value of “00:00:00” as an alternative of a “NULL” value to order data in the search_tweet() function appropriately.
